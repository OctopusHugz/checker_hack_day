# How To Use

1. Clone the directory to wherever you want to store this program

2. Run `./setup.py` from that directory

3. Then, work in your project directories as normal. From there, you have 2 options:

   - `ct`

     - This will check all tasks in the project

   - `ct filename`

     - This will check only the task specified by filename
       - This will sometimes break! If you find projects where this happens, please report them! I can't possibly check all edge cases.
