This is a personal side project spawned from the Checker Hack Day on October 2, 2020.

# How To Use

1. Clone the directory to wherever you want to store this program

2. Run `./setup.py` from that directory

3. Then, work in your project directories as normal. From there, you have 2 options:

   - `ct`

     - This will check all tasks in the project

   - `ct task_number`

     - This will check only the task specified by task_number
       - This may sometimes break! If you find projects where this happens, please report it so it can be fixed!

# Upcoming Features

1. Functionality to pass a range of tasks (like 0-3, for example)
   - For now, running `ct` and then stopping with `CTRL-C` is the best workaround!
